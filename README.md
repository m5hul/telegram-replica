This Telegram Replica is builtin React.js using tailwind css. I have tried to focus here on features that include search based animation on telegram, new message animation on telegram and making it mobile and web responsive. This is relient on get clients and get messages api, so is only reading messages. It do not have capability to send messages. 

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
